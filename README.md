# Second_Hackathon_Project
This was my team's project for Virginia State University's second Hackathon. This project was a great learning experience as we attempted to use React, a tool none of us were familiar with, 
and had to change plans more than halfway through our 24 hour work time. Through perseverance, our team managed to create a website prototype that exists to help students with their finacial needs.
Most of our feedback mentioned that the color pallete chosen was hard to see on some pages.

Our team was awarded **second place**
